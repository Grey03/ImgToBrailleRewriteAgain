# ImgToBrailleRewriteAgain
Wrote the whole thing again but now its an exe ooooo coolll!!!
Just run the MainExe or Shortcut to it

Please only use this for fun, Don't claim it as your own. learn from it if u want I guess

YOU MUST SELECT THE IMAGE FILE AND THE OUTPUT LOCATION
The Image file is the image you want to convert
The output location is the place the txt file will be placed

The change dimensions allows you to change the final dimensions of the letters so if it is 10 braille pieces tall or 6 braille piece wide (not the dots but the actual characters)
Give those final dimensions if you select this

I have a contrast slider which changes sensitivity
And finally there is the Invert, it will just invert the end

Click generate once you are happy with you settings
